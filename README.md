# sentiment_analysis
OBJECTIVE:
This project is on analysing the reviews of the Restaurant, Pan Asian in Chennai.
The analysis helps us understand whether majority of the customers are satisfied with the services or not. 
It also helps us to find the reasons why the restaurant must have been unfavourable to some. 
Thereby helping the company to make improvements to increase profits. 
We analysed the sentiments in the reviews based on two types of lexicons and then built a classifier to classify these sentiments.

ABOUT THE DATA:
The data of 878 reviews was scraped from the tripadvisor website using R.
The scraped data was then converted to csv format with the following columns:

review: review given by the customer.

star: rating given to the product by the customer
